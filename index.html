                    </header>

                    <div style="font-weight: bold !important">We’re going through some changes at Deveron Projects.
                        After leading the organisation through a transformational period and creating a new and exciting
                        model for the future of Deveron Projects, Natalia Palombo will step down from her role as
                        Director, in 2024.</div>

                    <p><em>A letter from Natalia: </em></p>

                    <p>I joined Deveron Projects in January 2021, marking the end of founder Claudia Zeiske&rsquo;s
                        25-year directorship. The period prompted an exciting new transition for the organisation. I
                        joined a phenomenal, yet small team and a supportive community in Huntly. Like many artworkers
                        in Scotland, my colleagues had been considering balance (in their roles, in the town) and values
                        (for the organisation and to shape how we worked in Huntly), so we paused and thought carefully
                        about how we wanted to work. In the process, we brought on two new full-time roles. As a team of
                        five full-time staff we&rsquo;ve come together with such kindness, enthusiasm, and passion for
                        the work we&rsquo;re doing, and hopefully sharing that intention with all our partners,
                        audiences and the artists we work with. A new model, vision, mission and objectives emerged
                        responding&nbsp;to the challenges the sector has faced over the last couple of years - economic
                        (standstill funding, cost of living crisis), political (BREXIT and its impacts on economy and
                        freedom of movement), social and health (Covid and the ongoing impacts of a global pandemic).
                    </p>

                    <p>The transition between Directors in 2021 and the development of a new model for the organisation
                        showed and continues to show the challenges of this quite typical structure of a
                        Director/Curator; where one person has ultimate responsibility, working across business and
                        creative, and holds networks and curatorial oversight. How do we make all aspects of the
                        organisation sustainable? With this in mind, we explored much flatter hierarchies which prompted
                        interesting conversations around responsibility &ndash; who would be open and prepared to take
                        this on and who would rather not.</p>

                    <p>For us, collaboration was the most formative change in our organisation. Part of my learning
                        curve was realising that building autonomy, equity and sustainability is not as simple as
                        flattening structures. I found ways to share decision-making, creative strategy, business
                        strategy, whilst hopefully maintaining balance by not sharing ultimate responsibility. Our full
                        team &ndash; across administration and creative &ndash; were part of all artists check-ins
                        (weekly meetings with full-time artists in residence, monthly for part-time artists in
                        residence), in monthly business planning, new venue, and programming workshops. Building a
                        collaborative environment allowed a new model to emerge.</p>

                    <p><u>A new model</u></p>

                    <p>I&rsquo;m incredibly proud of the work we&rsquo;ve done through a transformational time for the
                        organisation: increasing project funding and team capacity; developing exciting new
                        partnerships, nationally and internationally; committed substantial resource to the development
                        of artistic practice in Scotland and wider, bringing artists&rsquo; fees to the same value as
                        staff salaries; addressing urgent social, cultural and political issues; while working with the
                        wellbeing and collaboration with our communities in Huntly at the heart.&nbsp;Bringing the
                        organisation into a distinct new phase, I feel that my time has naturally come to an end.
                        Working in earnest on our new business plan and looking ahead to the next round of Creative
                        Scotland core funding, my decision to step down has presented an ideal opportunity for us to
                        further develop a sustainable model for the future of the organisation. To this end, we are
                        introducing a shared directorship between two existing staff members: Jenny Salmean and Matthew
                        Evans, currently Producer and Project Manager respectively.</p>

                    <p>Jenny and Matthew have rooted themselves in Huntly long-term and have exceptional experience
                        across visual art, theatre and performance, in Scotland and wider. This new model - retaining
                        local, sector and organisational knowledge in the team - will ensure that the strength and
                        success that the organisation has built forms the core of an exciting future and reflects the
                        unique context that we work in.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>A new website, detailing our values - based on Community, Collaboration, Rigour and
                            Solidarity, will launch in Autumn 2023. &nbsp;</strong></p>

                        and multimedia artist Ms Alibalio is gathering local knowledge and history for use as the
                        foundation of her work on the traditional processes. Having never weaved or spun before engaging
                        with the topic during her time in Huntly, Ms Alibalio&#39;s previous work has always focused on
                        inherited and embodied knowledge. A Deveron Projects spokesperson said she aims to apply this
                        lens to the key touchstones of Scottish domestic life. The spokesperson said she aims to
                        explore: &quot;knowledge that is not learned from a book or other resource, but the idea that we
                        hold knowledge in our bodies, inherited from past generations&quot;.&quot;<br />

                        a free Christmas lunch for Huntly. The meal at Square Deal, from 2pm on Christmas Day, is open

                        (...)<br />
                        The space can be used by anyone with a community cause in mind, and has a busy schedule of arts
                        events taking place through-out the year.&nbsp;Rosie said Square Deal was the perfect venue for
                        the lunch. She said: &ldquo;There was a space and it made sense to use it.<br />
                        &ldquo;Square Deal should be used more and Deveron Projects want it to be used more, if people
                        have some kind of community idea.<br />
                        &ldquo;And it is free for communities to use it for things like this, so it is really nice to
                        use the space.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />

                    <p>Christine Borland&rsquo;s four-year research project with Deveron Arts explores the history of
                        Huntly&rsquo;s thriving linen industry. Taking flax as a starting point, Borland weaves
                        connections across communities, geographies and histories. Susan Mansfield meets the artist to
                        find out more.</p>

                    <p>...</p>

                    <p>Borland&rsquo;s engagement with flax began on a residency with socially engaged arts organisation
                        Deveron Projects in the Aberdeenshire town of Huntly in early 2019. Noticing similarities to her
                        hometown of Darvel in Ayrshire, she realised that Huntly had been a flax-growing town in the
                        18th century, and set out to investigate that history by learning to grow, harvest, spin and
                        weave flax.</p>

                        documents which allow people to reflect on Huntly&rsquo;s history.</p>

                    <p>Using archives of The Huntly Express, the Nigerian artist has reproduced stories, articles and
                        poems from the local newspaper&rsquo;s 159-year history.&nbsp;Ay&ocirc; delved into the archives
                        &ndash; which are stored in the Brander Library building &ndash; during a short-term commission
                        with Deveron Projects in 2021.&nbsp;The end result is a fascinating insight into the history of
                        the paper and the town since 1863 and produced in the shape of three publications designed and
                        printed in the style of the newspaper.</p>

                    <p>Learning how to create your own compost is a valuable skill. Lindy explained: &quot;Home made
                        compost is the magic solution to so many gardening problems. It improves your soil, makes your
                        garden fertile, stops your garden from drying out too quick and also stops it from getting
                        waterlogged. Best of all it&#39;s free and uses up your kitchen rubbish.&quot; For different
                        ways to compost, Lindy says that you can &quot;choose a compost method for whatever size space
                        you have. If all you&#39;ve got is a balcony or small outdoor space, opt for a wormery. If you
                        have lots of space, you could go for a comprehensive three or four bay system. You can always
                        get a cheap compost bin from the council too.&quot;<br />

                    <p>&#39;EDINBURGH &mdash; Dig, rake, sow, riddle, water, weed, pull, ripple, winnow. For her solo
                        exhibition at Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, In Relation to Linum, Christine Borland created a
                        series of rituals around these actions for the growing and harvesting of the flax plant, linum
                        usitatissimum. The name means &ldquo;most useful&rdquo;; flax seeds have many medicinal
                        properties, while the fibers can&nbsp;be spun into linen, one of the oldest known forms of
                        fabric in the world. Unable to sow flax at the Royal Botanic Garden during its pandemic closure
                        in 2020, Borland sent packets of seeds to a group of women gardeners around the UK and asked
                        them to carry out the same seasonal rites as they nurtured their plants.&#39;<br />

                    <p>&#39;A wealth of information about the social, economic and botanical history of flax lies behind
                        this show, but Borland knows better than to foreground it. What she foregrounds is process.
                        Having learned the processes around growing, harvesting and drying it (spinning and weaving are
                        still to come), she grew a crop herself during lockdown with the help of an online community of
                        other growers. The works in this show, beautifully displayed in the Georgian rooms of Climate
                        House, explore these processes in words, in delicate watercolours on flax paper, and in displays
                        of samples which are part museology, part art&#39;.<br />

                        gardens, allotments and co-opted public spaces instead.&#39;<br />

                        keeping in touch about their respective crops on social media. Now their harvest has been

                    <p>She skipped the cultural buzz of London life when Claudia Zeiske arrived in the market town of
                        Huntly with her young family nearly 30 years ago. She searched for a nearby arts center around
                        her and found that there was none. Prior to pursuing a career in human rights work with the
                        British Refugee Council in London, Zeiske had studied social anthropology in Berlin and London.
                        As she says, while living in northeast Scotland at the time, focusing on human rights was not a
                        choice. At the National Galleries of Scotland&rsquo;s Duff House in nearby Banff, she took a
                        position as a construction manager, but still craved the artistic buzz of the arts on her
                        doorstep. She decided to create an arts center herself after many discussions over food and wine
                        with like-minded peers. &ldquo;At first, my ideas were quite traditional,&rdquo; she recalls.
                        &ldquo;It was about taking art that was being created and shown in a city and bringing it to a
                        smaller version in the country.&rdquo;<br />

                    <p>For our winter board meeting this year we visited Hospitalfields, an arts centre and historic
                        house in Arbroath.</p>


                    <strong>Hospitalfields, Arbroath </strong>

                    <p>The building and gardens have a fascinating history, dating back to the monks who first lived on
                        the site in the 13th century. We were given a tour of the place by director Lucy Byatt who told
                        us about her exciting redevelopment plans &ndash; we were especially interested in the
                        restoration plans for the Victorian fernery and the walled gardens.</p>

                    <p>During our stay we were treated to some delicious meals by Hospialfields&rsquo; new chef Gillian
                        Veal. Gillian is a trained artist and uses her interest in the history of Hospitalfieds to
                        inform her cooking. She is currently working with volunteers and garden staff on plans to grow
                        heritage varieties of herbs, fruit and vegetables.</p>

                    <p>During the board meeting we reflected our 21st anniversary celebrations at the end of last year
                        and our recent change of name, and discussed new ways forward for Deveron Projects in the years
                        to come.</p>

                        the community.</p>

                            the song, the lore embedded in the land&#39;</em>. Her research will focus on specific
                        locations in Aberdeenshire &nbsp;&ndash; place-names, landmarks, ecologies, and landscapes
                        &ndash; as they appear within the song lyrics sung by deceased and current tradition-bearers,

                        fisher-folk.&nbsp;She will also draw on the work of scholars, such as nineteenth century
                        collector Francis James Child, a large portion of whose collection, was gathered in this area;
                        early twentieth century folklorists David Greig and James Duncan whose impressive catalogue of
                        lyrics and tunes of the North-East was surveyed by Scottish place-names expert W.F.H.Nicolaisen
                        in his toponymy research; and mid twentieth century folklorist Hamish Henderson whose vast
                        archive of recordings is held in the School of Scottish Studies.</p>

                        time! And do come along to the <a href="/events/pathmakers-gathering-river-talks/">Pathmaker's
                            Gathering</a> on Sunday the 17th, free to attend (though booking is essential.) Speaking of
                        tickets, be sure to get involved with <a href="/events/white-wood-forum/">The White Wood
                            Forum</a> at the end of May, for a weekend of discussions, theater, pomp and ceremony, with
                        a great host of respected keynote speakers.<br /><br />During the past week we were also getting
                        ready for the Huntly Farmer's Market on Saturday the 2cnd, which turned out to be a seaonably
                        sunny and warm day. Our seed bombs burst on to the scene, and proved to be an explosive success
                        among child and adult alike. The day was spent demonstrating and equipping folk with the
                        materials to make their own scottish wildflower bombs with just a knob of clay, a pinch of
                        compost, and a dash of seeds!</p>

                        Wood on 28 May 2016.</p>
                    <p>The <a href="http://www.deveron-arts.com/caroline-wendling/">White Wood</a> was planted by the
                        community of Huntly in March 2015. It is located in the Bin Forest and is home to 49 oak trees,
                        over 700 native trees and another 1000 of plants and herbs which will flower in white. The White
                        Wood was planted in commemoration of WWI, as a space of remembrance, reflection and regrowth.
                    </p>
                    <p>The wood will officially be opened on 28 May during a <a

                        activity for the White Wood opening that represents your community organisation. Funding can be

                    </div>

                    <p>Amanda Catto, Head of Visual Art at Creative Scotland, as part of a Scotland wide visual arts
                        review, joined us for a day discussing living and working as an artist in a rural context. Some
                        fascinating pechacuchas were presented to the very receptive audience in attendance. The
                        audience was in the majority artists engaged in a rural setting. The attending artists had many
                        insights and contributed to the overall group discussions with gusto. Many experiences held by
                        the artists were shared and common to the group: information and possible solutions to seemingly
                        individual problems helped to bolster the sense of creative community that rural artists can
                        often feel excluded from. Praises of the values that rural settings embody were also vocalised
                        quite enthusiastically. It was a very enriching and informative event, which ended on a hopeful
                        note, with Amanda thanking the group for their discussions that help to inform Creative Scotland
                        of the values and needs of the rural artist.</p>
                    <p>Some tweets from the day include:<br /><em>"The studio is our home. The way we live is our
                            practice."</em><br /><em>"Limitations can challenge the medium you're working in. Be more
                            resourceful as artists."</em><br />Follow the discussion on&nbsp;<a

                            and in some developed countries too, is high. Through my research I try to address this
                            grave issue from a different perspective - to attract children towards schools through the
                            creation of an environment that will enhance their learning experience, and therefore

                        railway line. The line was closed as part of the infamous Beeching cuts which led to the closure
                        of more than 30 per cent of British railways in the 1960s.</p>

                        of us having been before, we decided to make a team trip out of it. In true Deveron Arts style
                        we used each leg of the journey to frame a series of discussions concerning our areas of
                        investigation and future programming. As such, we talked about hospitality, the future of
                        Scotland post-referendum and pilgrimage, to name but a few.</p>
                    <p>During the festival we attended some very interesting talks on subjects ranging from the first
                        world war to Russian poets; listened to a trio playing traditional folk music from Eastern
                        Europe, Japan and beyond; took a walk down to inspect the salt marshes; and spent a lot of time
                        in second hand bookshops - we all came home with more books than we could carry!</p>

                        the North East of Scotland</div>

                    <p>Five major arts organisations based in Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen City (Scottish Sculpture
                        Workshop, Sound Festival, Deveron Arts, Woodend Barn and Gray's School of Art) are collaborating
                        to deliver <i>Skills Biennale 2014</i>. The theme will be Food And Sustainability creating the
                        platform for five collaborations between artists and local food practices (small businesses,
                        artisans, community groups and food banks).</p>
                    <p></p>



                    <p>Each organisation will curate a Slow Prototype (SP) bringing together internationally renowned
                        contemporary artists with crafts/trades people in residencies of up to 4 weeks in August /
                        September 2014. Each SP is about different sets of skills coming together on equal terms and
                        mutually affecting each other, generating something unexpected, unfolding through each
                        collaboration.</p>
                    <p>The North East of Scotland has a reputation as Scotland's larder (fishing, Aberdeen Angus,
                        traditional products such as shortbread and whisky...) but there is not a reputation for eating
                        well in the North East. The five invited artists will spend time engaging with local food
                        organisations and the local community. The creativity of artists and their curiosity will
                        question the paradox of a less than ideal diet in a place of amazing produce.</p>
                    <p>A broad view will be taken of food production and consumption: ranging from artisanal food, to
                        leftovers and food banks; surplus as well as scarcity will be considered. We will look both at
                        Aberdeen's inner city (where there are large areas of deprivation) and at rural Aberdeenshire,
                        traditionally a farming community. We want to know the reality of food production and
                        consumption in these places and engage in conversation with the public at large.</p>
                    <p>The artists and food projects will be selected by each arts organisation:</p>
                    <p>- Gray's School of Art: Celia Gonzalez and Community Food Initiatives North East looking at food
                        security;&nbsp;<br /><br />- Sound festival: Stephen Montague composer and Brewdog, looking at
                        the sounds of a brewery;&nbsp;<br /><br />- Deveron Arts: Gayle Chong Kwan looking at issues of
                        waste with Deans Shortbread;</p>
                    <p>- Scottish Sculpture Workshop (located in an old bakery): Stephen Brandes and a local mill
                        producing oatmeal;&nbsp;<br /><br />- Woodend Barn: Tom Pritchard choreographer and an artisan
                        cheese monger, looking specifically at the senses.</p>
                    <p>The project will culminate in the form of a 2-day Skills Biennale on the
                        6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;September 2014, taking visitors on a coach tour of the collaborations:
                        &nbsp;the results of Slow Prototype projects &nbsp;(performances and exhibitions) will show the
                        breadth and quality of work that is created in Aberdeenshire. A one-day bus tour is available to
                        tour around the five projects, allowing audiences to see all five Slow Prototypes.</p>
                    <p>Coach departs Grays School of Art, Aberdeen at 9.30am and will visit Aberdeen Foodbank - Banchory
                        / Cambus O'May - Lumsden / Alford - Huntly - Ellon.&nbsp; Returning to Aberdeen approx
                        8pmBiennale Tour - &pound;15 / &pound;10 conc. (full time students, u/waged, o/60s) includes
                        light refreshments throughout the day.</p>
                    <p>You can see the results so far of the collaboration between Gayle Chong Kwan and Deans Shortbread
                        in the Stewarts Hall, Huntly between 1.30pm and 5pm, on Saturday
                        6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;September.&nbsp;</p>

                        known about him back in Scotland, his home country. Xenson and Sanaa intend to bring his story
                        back to the country of his birth, reversing the flow of his teachings and investigating the
                        spiritual and communal condition of his roots by walking a boat, conducting services, making
                        unusual things....</p>




                    <p>On the day of his arrival, Tuesday 3rd June 2014, Xension informed Deveron Arts of the current

                        young men, from various Christian denominations, that were killed by Kabaka Mwanga in 1886. In

                    <p>This Silent Walk led by artist Vivian Caccuri at Niter&oacute;i's coast was a four-hour route
                        along the seaside path between the Museu of Contemporary Art of Niteroi and Jurujuba, a
                        traditional fishing neighbourhood of the city. A group of twenty people walked under a vow of
                        silence along the beaches, squares, halls, decks and private spaces, meeting unexpected
                        situations, special acoustic impressions and improvised urban conditions that foster perceptions
                        of noise and images of the city. By the end of the walk, participants gathered for a meal in
                        Jurujuba to talk again.</p>

                        maternity and childhood, Nancy, in collaboration with local artist Norma D Hunter, hosted a

                        with during her residency. These mothers were then given the opportunity to try the Mbereko -
                        carrying their baby on their back using a cloth - for a walk to our empty shop. Here the mothers
                        and children participated in a workshop to make dolls from recycled materials and engaged in a
                        conversation with two experts on the role of toys in childhood. The day was enjoyed by all, and
                        a lively debate on toys and their uses ensued.</p>

                    <p>Around 20 local walkers joined Michael on Sunday to start his 14 day pilgrimage around Huntly in
                        some very misty and wet weather.&nbsp;Fed well however by Daisy Williamson and her family crew
                        with cinamon buns and other heart warmers.</p>



                    <p>A 10am start from the tin hut took the group through mud and bogs, uphill and down dale to a very
                        welcome picnic of corn and potato chowder, sandwiches and wraps, cakes and of course 'Tap O'
                        Noth' cinnamon buns from the Huntly Signature Menu, provided and set up by Daisy Williamson and
                        her family. With revived spirits from the delicious lunch the group set off again to finish up
                        at the Ashgrove Petrol Station. Here after a welcome cup of tea Michael set off alone to find
                        camp.</p>
                    <p>On Wednesday 28th November our Shadow Curator Elisabetta Rattalino joins Michael for a day and

                        compositional research, these images explore the notion of bus, or public transport, as a social
                        environment marked by gendered power relations in which women remain objectified.'</p>
